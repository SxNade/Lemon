**Lemon is a very simple bash script to search for basic/easy-wins privilige escalation vectors on Linux machines** 

****LEMON IS STILL UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**

*contributions are welcomed*



# On the Go one Liner

        curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SxNade/Lemon/main/lemon -o lemon ; chmod +x lemon ; ls -la lemon


# Note

*Lemon by no means is a replacement for manual enumeration for privlige escalation, its just aimed at automating some basic checks that a user would do to search for easy wins.*

*Lemon searches for most common known misconfiguration, more code is yet to be added and reformatted*
