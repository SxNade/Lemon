**Lemon is a User Interactive bash program to search for basic/easy-wins privilige escalation vectors on Linux ** 

**LEMON IS STILL UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**

*contributions are welcomed*

# Running Lemon

        $ git clone https://github.com/SxNade/Lemon
        $ cd Lemon
        $ chmod +x lemon
        
        $ ./lemon




# On the Go one Liner

        curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SxNade/Lemon/main/lemon -o lemon ; chmod +x lemon ; ls -la lemon


# Note

*Lemon by no means is a replacement for manual enumeration for privlige escalation, its just aimed at automating some basic checks that a user would do to search for easy wins.*

*Lemon searches for most common known misconfiguration, more code is yet to be added and reformatted*
